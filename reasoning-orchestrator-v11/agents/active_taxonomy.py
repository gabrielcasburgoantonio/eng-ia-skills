    Core mechanisms:
    1. REASONING GAP DETECTION: When a problem fails, identify which
       taxonomy types COULD HAVE helped but weren't activated.
    2. ADAPTIVE WEIGHTING: Each reasoning type gets a dynamic weight
       based on historical success, updated after every problem.
    3. GAP-DRIVEN ACTIVATION: Automatically activates reasoning types
       that historically helped in similar problems.
    4. PCI IMPACT TRACKING: Measures how much each reasoning type
       contributes to the final PCI.
